## Research-Based Best Practices

Based on analysis of successful PhD defense posts on LinkedIn (posts with 100+ likes and 20+ comments):

### Key Elements of High-Engagement Posts

1. **Strong Hook** (First 2 lines are crucial - they appear in preview)
   - Start with "I defended my PhD!" or similar milestone announcement
   - Creates immediate emotional connection

2. **Personal Story Arc**
   - Brief mention of the journey (years, challenges overcome)
   - Makes the achievement relatable

3. **Clear Problem Statement**
   - What real-world problem does your research address?
   - Why does it matter?

4. **Quantified Contributions**
   - Use specific numbers (%, x improvement, ms latency)
   - List 3-5 key achievements with metrics

5. **Skills Showcase**
   - Technical skills relevant to target roles
   - Tools, frameworks, platforms used

6. **Forward-Looking Statement**
   - What are you looking for next?
   - What problems do you want to solve?

7. **Gratitude Section**
   - Thank advisor, committee, collaborators
   - Creates engagement through tagging

8. **Strategic Hashtags**
   - Mix of broad (#PhD #MachineLearning) and specific (#ReinforcementLearning)
   - Include #OpenToWork if job seeking
   - 8-12 hashtags optimal
